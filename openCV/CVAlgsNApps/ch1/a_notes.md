### Intro 
* Stanley Stanford robot
* General: 
    - Computer just sees a grid of numbers. 
    - Involved is: noisy data, corrupted data, distorted data.
    - This noise is usually dealt with statistical methods.
        + ie. edge detection. 


### General OpenCv Info
* [URL](http://SourceForge.net/projects/opencvlibrary)
* Reliable Documentation = Site itself; HTML pages inside repo are outdated.

### Overview: OpenCV Structure & Content 
* 5 main components: CV, MLL, HighGUI, CXCORE, CvAux (experimental stage)
    - CV: Image processing & Vision Algorithms 
    - MLL: Stat Classifiers & Clustering tools
    - HighGUI: GUI, Images & Video I/O
    - CXCORE: Basic structs & algos, XML support, drawing functions
    - CvAux: Embedded HMM Facial Recognition.
        + Eye/Mouth tracking, Camera calibration
    - Interested in using myself: CV, MLL, CXCORE
